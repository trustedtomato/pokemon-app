For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## TODO
- [ ] limit number of characters in search when using fuzzy-search because its performance cost increases when the number of characters increase 
- [ ] add unit tests for everything (reach 100% coverage)
- [ ] display even more things on the Pokemon modal
